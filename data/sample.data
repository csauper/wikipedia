##Jaundice## !!causes!! When   red blood cells  die, the  heme  in their  haemoglobin  is converted to  bilirubin  in the  spleen  and in the hepatocytes in the liver. The  bilirubin  is processed by the  liver , enters  bile  and is eventually excreted through  feces . Consequently, there are three different classes of causes for jaundice. Pre-hepatic or hemolytic causes, where too many red blood cells are broken down, hepatic causes where the processing of  bilirubin  in the liver does not function correctly, and post-hepatic or extrahepatic causes, where the removal of bile is disturbed. 
##Chronic_cold_urticaria## !!causes!! The hives are a  histamine  reaction in response to cold stimuli, including a drastic drop in temperature, cold air, and cold water. There are many causes for cold hives, most are  idiopathic  (meaning they have no known cause). Some rare conditions can cause cold hives, and it can be useful to test for these conditions if the cold hives are in any way unusual. 
##Hypophosphatemia## !!causes!! * Refeeding syndrome  This causes a demand for phosphate in cells due to the action of  phosphofructokinase , an enzyme which attaches phosphate to glucose to begin metabolism of this. Also, production of  ATP  when cells are fed and recharge their energy supplies, requires phosphate.  *  Respiratory alkalosis  Any alkalemic condition moves phosphate out of the blood into cells. This includes most common respiratory alkalemia (a higher than normal blood pH from low carbon dioxide levels in the blood), which in turn is caused by any hyperventilation (such as sepsis, fever, pain, anxiety, drug withdrawal).  *  Alcohol abuse  Alcohol impairs phosphate absorption, and alcoholics are also after malnurished with regard to minerals. In addition, alcohol treatment is associated with refeeding, and the stress alcohol withdrawal may create respiratory alkalosis, which exacerbates hypophosphatemia (see above).  *  Malabsorption  This includes GI damage, and also failure to absorb phosphate due to lack of vitamin D, or chronic use of phosphate binders such as  sucralfate , aluminum-containing antacids, and (more rarely) calcium-containing antacids.  * Hyperexcretion of phosphate in the urine ( phosphaturia ). This includes excess excretion from renal dysfunction, and also the action of many classes of  diuretics . Additionally, both primary and secondary  hyperparathyroidism  causes hyperexcretion of phosphate in the urine. Other rarer causes include * Certain blood cancers such as lymphoma or leukemia *  hereditary  causes *  hepatic failure  
##Synkinesis## !!causes!! Almost all cases of synkinesis develop as a sequel to nerve trauma (the exception is when it is congenitally acquired as in  Duane-Retraction Syndrome  and  Marcus Gunn phenomenon ). Trauma to the nerve can be induced in cases such as surgical procedures, nerve inflammation,  neuroma  , and physical injury.    Ephaptic transmission is when two nerves communicate with each other via an artificial synapse between nerves. Healthy peripheral nerves are insulated with a myelin sheath that helps to both enhance electric transmission and to prevent cross-talk between parallel nerves. After a lesion, it has been observed that regenerating nerves might not be myelinated effectively. Consequently, the two nerve fibers can come into contact and provide a means for an impulse to be directly conducted through the nerve membrane. An example to clarify this is having two uninsulated electrical wires placed adjacent to each other. Thus, the two nerves are able to ?cross-talk? and send action potentials in both directions. 
##Urethral_stricture## !!causes!! Urethral strictures are generally caused by either injury-related trauma to the tract or by a viral or bacterial infection of the tract, often caused by certain  STD's . The body's attempt to repair the damage caused by the injury or infection creates a buildup of scar tissue in the tract resulting in a significant narrowing or even closure of the passage. Instrumentation of the urethra, particularly before the advent of flexible uro-endoscopy, was (and remains) an important causative event. Short strictures in the bulbar urethra, particularly between the proximal 1/3 and distal 2/3 of the bulb, may be congenital. They probably form as a membrane at the junction between the posterior and anterior urethral segments. It is not usually noticeable until later in life, as it fails to widen as the urethra does with growth, thus it only impedes urinary flow relative to the rest of the urethra after puberty. Moreover, the patient will often not "know any different", and so will not complain about poor flow. The urethra runs between the legs very close to the skin, leaving it vulnerable to trauma.  Simply falling off a bike and hitting between the legs may result in the formation of scar tissue within the urethra tract.  This condition is often not found until the patient has problems urinating because these are painless growths of scar tissue. Passage of  kidney stones  through the urethra can be painful and subsequently  can lead to urethral strictures.
